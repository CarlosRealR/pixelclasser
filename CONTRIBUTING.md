## How you can contribute

pixelclasser is not stable yet, but almost, so the best way to contribute is contacting the package maintainer by email [email][mailto:carlos.real@usc.es]. When the first stable version will be released (1.0.0), issue creation will be allowed in the pixlclasser repository as another way to post questions, ideas or bug reports.
