If you are reading this document, you have probably been using `pixelclasser` in your work, so it is a pleasure to receive your comments, suggestions and bug reports.

## How you can contribute

The purpose of `pixelclasser` is to classify RGB images using a simplified form of the multivariate technique known as Support Vector Machine. The functions that it contains are simple and few, and are designed to be integrated in your workflow as one of the initial steps in the analysis of your images.

Because it is a small piece of code, I hope that the number of bugs would be correspondingly small. Being simple, creating your own scripts using pixelclasser should be simple as well. Having said this, it is also true that bugs always creep in, and good ideas and improvements are always out there, as demonstrated the peer-review process of the package. So if you wish to report a bug or propose some improvement that you consider interesting or necessary, there are two ways:
* Open an issue in the code repository of pixelclaser: https://github.com/ropensci/pixelclasser
* Send me an e-mail to mailto:carlos.real@usc.es, if you are not used to gitHub or prefer a private conversation.

Making me know that you used `pixelclasser` in your research and how badly (or well) things gone, is another way to help to improve the package. Also, if you are creating your scripts (or package) that use `pixelclasser`, do not hesitate to ask me if you have some question or problem.
